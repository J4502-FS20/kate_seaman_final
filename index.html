<h2>About the Artist</h2>
<p>Kate Seaman is a freelance photojournalist mainly focused on her familyâ€™s history and connection to certain spaces across the Northern American continent. She bases most of her work primarily in Nova Scotia, Canada and the Texas Hill country. Her connection is based in family near those places and a desire for a slower and different feeling from the fast-paced New York life. She focuses, not only, on the people of the area, but also the nature and beauty of the surrounding region. From ranches in Texas to the sea-salt air of Nova Scotia, she focuses on the area beyond New York. </p>
<h2> </h2> 
<p>Currently, she is working on her undergraduate degree in Journalism, with an interest area in Photojournalism at the University of Missouri - Columbia. She will graduate in 2021. </p>
