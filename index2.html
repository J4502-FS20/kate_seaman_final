    	<h1>Types of Anabaptists</h1>
      <hr/>
    	<h2>The Anabaptists emphasize a literal interpretation of the teachings of Jesus, especially the Sermon on the Mount. They practice the teachings of Jesus in daily life, and they give greater importance to the Bible than to civil government. They are some of the earliest supporters of the separation of church and state.</h2>

    			<h3>Old Order Amish</h3>
    			<p>The Old Order Amish are the largest group of rural Amish settlements. Old Order Amish communities often prohibit the use of buttons and zippers. They also wear dark colors. The communities regulate hair length, men must grow beards an acceptable length, and women are not allowed to get haircuts. They avoid modern technologies like cars, electricity and tractors.</p>

    			<h3>New Order Amish</h3>
    			<p>Similar to the Old Order Amish, with slightly relaxed rules governing dress and technology. Colorful clothing is permitted, and men are allowed to trim beards. The communities allow some modern technologies, like telephones and tractors. They are stricter than the Old Order Amish when it comes some practices, like the prohibition of alcohol and tobacco.</p>

    			<h3>Mennonite</h3>
    			<p>In general, Mennonites are more assimilated into mainstream culture. Although some Old Order Mennonite groups use horse-and-buggy transportation, many Mennonites drive cars, wear contemporary clothing, support higher education and use modern technology. More conservative Mennonite groups dress in plain clothing but drive cars, have telephones in their homes, and use electricity from public power lines.</p>

      <p>The Clark Amish community was settled in 1953 and is currently one of Missouri's largest Amish settlements, <a href= "https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/files/2020/10/Amish_Pop_by_state_and_county_2020.pdf">alongside the Seymour and Jamesport settlements.</a> There are over 1,530 people spread out over more than 15 square miles in Audrain, Randolph & Monroe counties with more than 50 family operated businesses. </p>
      <p>The community was founded primarily by Iowa Amish seeking greater freedom after conflicts over education in the state.  The Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online describes the Amish families of the Clark settlement living “in a tightly knit area with Amish farms adjacent to each other for miles along its country roads”. </p>
      <p> The Clark Amish is an Old Order Amish settlement. </p>
