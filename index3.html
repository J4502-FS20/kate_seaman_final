<h2>The Rules of the Amish</h2>
<hr/>
<ul>
  <li>Motorized vehicles are not to be owned or driven. The Amish may request a neighbor to drive them, or may hire a driver and rent a car.</li>
  <li>Clothing codes are to be followed:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Males are to wear hats when outside. Black is for the winter, straw color is for the warmer months.</li>
        <li>Suspenders, not belts, keep up the trousers.</li>
        <li>Once boys marry, they are expected to grow a beard but shave their upper lip. Unmarried boys must be clean-shaven.</li>
        <li>Mustaches are frowned upon.</li>
        <li>Clothing must be home sewn.</li>
        <li>Women are never to shave any part of their body nor to cut their hair.</li>
        <li>Females must keep their head covered, usually with a prayer bonnet. The color denotes marital status (different colors may be used by different settlements).</li>
        </ul>
<li>Social Security or other commercial insurance is forbidden.</li>
<li>Children are to attend school through the eighth grade. After that, they are expected to work on the farm or in the home. A parent may find them a job to bring in additional income for the family.</li>
<li>Full-length mirrors are forbidden, because they are thought to promote vanity and self-admiration.</li>
<li>Jewelry is not to be worn, not even wedding rings. Other symbols (beards for men, and black bonnets for women) are used, in lieu of rings, to represent marital status.</li>
<li>An Amish person who has taken the church vow, and who has been found guilty by the bishop of breaking one of the Ordnung rules, can be punished by the Meidung (excommunication or shunning).</li>
<li>Mobile vehicles, such as buggies or farm implements, must not have rubber tires.</li>
<li>(Among the Old Order) Church members must not be photographed.</li>
<li>(Among the Old Order) Telephones are forbidden.</li>
<li>The use of batteries is allowed (in some districts) for emergency flashlights and similar devices, but discouraged in the home.</li>
<li>Word processors (powered by generator or DC) are allowed for school and church administrative use. Only non-electric typewriters are used in the home.</li>
<li>Electricity is not allowed in the home. Electrical energy is allowed in community dairy barns, but only generator power (not grid power).</li>
<li>Those who are able to work must do so from Monday through Saturday. On Sunday, however, no laborious work is to be done.</li>
<li>Amish young women and young men are expected to marry other Amish.</li>
<li>Electricity from utility companies is considered worldly. Bottled gas may be used to heat water, fuel ranges, and run refrigerators. Gas-pressured or kerosene lanterns provide lighting. Batteries power the red lights on buggies. Gasoline generators may provide energy for washing machines, water pumps, and agricultural equipment.</li>
<li>Telephones may be placed in booths, an unlocked barn, or an Amish school. Cellular phones and voice mail, may only be used by a business to compete, but this is permitted on a case by case basis.</li>
<li>The Amish travel in horse-drawn buggies, and use horses to pull farm machinery. The horse allows them to take life at a slower pace, and it puts limits on their lives, slowing their work, and requiring additional labor. If business or personal needs necessitate a longer drive, the Amish may hire a taxi.</li>
<li>The Amish complete their eighth grade education in a one-room private school, taught by an Amish teacher who also attended school through the eighth grade. The skills of spelling, English, Pennsylvania German, mathematics, geography, and health are taught. Some basic science may be taught about animals, stars, and planets. Religion is not taught as a subject, but is an important part of the school program, especially as it relates to behavior.</li>
