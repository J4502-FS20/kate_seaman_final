<h3> Ordnung</h3>
<hr/>
      <div class="biblequote">
  <p> <i> “Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.” </i> </p>
  <p> Matthew 7:13-14 </p>
      </div>
  <hr/>
    <div class="ordnung">
<p> The Amish have two guidelines for daily living: the New Testament and the Ordnung. </p>
<p> The Amish accept a literal interpretation of the bible and their belief is in separation from the outside world. Ordnung is the German word for “order”. It is what the Amish beliefs and faith are led by and are the blueprint for expected behavior. </p>
<p> For the Ordnung, their is no need to write regulations down - it is passed on by oral tradition. Rules of the Ordnung vary between Amish communities. </p>
<p>If a member of the community is found in violation of the ordnung, church ministry will visit the offender and ask them to cease the deviant behavior. If a member remains in violation of the rules, the individual may be excommunicated by the bishop.
  Excommunication is also known as being in the Bann, and entails the practice of Meidung, or social shunning.</p>
<p> Even though an individual may be excommunicated, there is always the possibility of return. An excommunicated member may return at any time, make a confession before the bishop or the church, and usually after a six-week period, be reinstated into the church.</p>
    </div>
<hr/>
<ul>
  <li> Clothing codes are to be followed:</li>
  <div class="dress"> Dress among the Amish signals submission to the collective order and serves as a public symbol of group identity. </div>
        <div class="list">
        <li> Males are to wear hats when outside. Black is for the winter, straw color is for the warmer months.</li>
        <li> Suspenders, not belts, keep up the trousers.</li>
        <li> Once boys marry, they are expected to grow a beard but shave their upper lip. Unmarried boys must be clean-shaven.</li>
        <li> Mustaches are frowned upon - they have a long history of being associated with the military.</li>
        <li> Clothing must be home sewn.</li>
        <li> Jewelry is not to be worn, not even wedding rings. Other symbols (beards for men, and black bonnets for women) are used, in lieu of rings, to represent marital status.</li>
        <li> Women are never to shave any part of their body nor to cut their hair.</li>
        <li> Females must keep their head covered, usually with a prayer bonnet.</li>
        <li> Women are expected to wear a head covering and a three-piece dress that includes a cape and an apron. </li>
        </div>
<li> Social Security or other commercial insurance is forbidden.</li>
    <div class="list">
          <li> The Amish believe the Bible tells them to care for church members who have special needs and the elderly. </li>
          <li> To rely on commercial or government insurance would contradict their belief that God will care for them through the church. </li>
          </div>
<li> Children are to attend school through the eighth grade.</li>
    <div class="list">
        <li> Once they have completed school, boys will begin working either for their father or their father will help them line a job up to start making money for the family. </li>
        <li> The girls will begin to stay at home and help out more with laundry, dishes, house cleaning.</li>
      </div>
<li> Full-length mirrors are forbidden, because they are thought to promote vanity and self-admiration.</li>
<li> Members agree to obey the rules of the community at the time of baptism, with the clear understanding that they will be subject to church discipline, and perhaps excommunication, if they break that vow.</li>
<li> Mobile vehicles, such as buggies or farm implements, must not have rubber tires.</li>
<li> Motorized vehicles are not to be owned or driven. The Amish may request a neighbor to drive them, or may hire a driver and rent a car.</li>
<li> (Among the Old Order) Church members must not be photographed.</li>
  <div class="list">
    <li> Based on Exodus 20:4 - "Thou shall not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth." </li>
  </div>
<li> Musical instruments are forbidden by the Old-Order Amish community. </li>
    <div class="list">
      <li>Playing an instrument would be “worldly.” It is contrary to the spirit of <i><b>Glassenheit</b></i> (belief that includes simplicity, humility, thrift, obedience and accepting the will of higher authorities), and would stir up the emotions of those who are involved.</li>
    </div>
<li> (Among the Old Order) Telephones are forbidden.</li>
<li> (In some districts) The use of batteries is allowed for emergency flashlights and similar devices, but discouraged in the home.</li>
<li> Those who are able to work must do so from Monday through Saturday. On Sunday, however, no laborious work is to be done.</li>
<li> Amish young women and young men are expected to marry other Amish.</li>
<li> Electricity is not allowed in the home. Electrical energy is allowed in community dairy barns, but only generator power (not grid power).</li>
      <div class="list">
      <li> Easy access to Electricity could lead to many temptations and the deterioration of church and family life.</li>
      <li> Bottled gas may be used to heat water, fuel ranges and run refrigerators. </li>
      <li> Gas-pressured or kerosene lanterns provide lighting. Batteries power the red lights on buggies. </li>
      <li> Gasoline generators may provide energy for washing machines, water pumps and agricultural equipment.</li>
      </div>
<li> Telephones may be placed in booths, an unlocked barn or an Amish school.</li>
<li> Airplane travel is forbidden.</li>
<li> The Amish travel in horse-drawn buggies, and use horses to pull farm machinery.</li>
      <div class="list">
        <li> The horse allows them to take life at a slower pace, and it puts limits on their lives, slowing their work and requiring additional labor.</li>
      </div>
<li> The Amish complete their eighth grade education in a one-room private school, taught by an Amish teacher. </li>
        <div class="list">
          <li> The skills of spelling, English, Pennsylvania German, mathematics, geography and health are taught. </li>
          <li> Some basic science may be taught about animals, stars, and planets. </li>
          <li> Religion is not taught as a subject.</li>
        </div>
<li> The Amish are forbidden from attending high school or college, joining the military or having a divorce.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="rules"> Church leaders update the regulations as new issues arise.</div>
