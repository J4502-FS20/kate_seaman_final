<h3> Story</h3>

<div class= "container">
    <div class= "text">
<p> Eli and his roommates, Eli, Levi, and Levi, (to avoid confusion, they each had a nickname – Buster, Beaves, Mohawk and Lulu), have distanced themselves from their Amish roots as they adjust to the strange English world. </p>

<p>When an Amish person decides to leave their community, they are excommunicated. Their family is not supposed to talk to them, Amish men and women are not to do business with them and if they decide to come back, they must wait several weeks before they are reaccepted into the church. </p>

<p>They got rid of the clothes they grew up in, break all the rules of the Amish community and own few items that remind them of their time in the community. </p>

<p> “It’s f***ing bullshit,” the boys would respond whenever asked about the rules or why they were in place. </p>

<p>Buster has been out for almost six years, Beavis and Mohawk have been out for over a year and Lulu has been out for about eight months, however, he went back to his family in Iowa for a brief period before returning to Missouri.  </p>

<p>On Monday mornings, the boys went to work. </p>

<p>The four roommates worked together in roofing. They spent the weekdays together traveling around mid-Missouri fixing roofs. </p>

<p>When Friday came, the boys let loose. </p>

<p>Most weekends, the boys and their friends would party and then drive out to the Amish Community they grew up in. They yell, sing, turn their speakers up all the way, do burnouts in their trucks, and, in a few instances, set off fireworks in the community. </p>

<p> “We need to give the Amish kids inspiration to get up in the morning,” Buster said about the activities. “We want to show off our freedom.”  </p>

<p>When they leave their community, they take next to nothing with them. </p>

<p>The boys’ parents or family members will occasionally show up at the house to convince one or more of the boys to come home. When the boys see them at a store in the Amish community or visit them at home, they will try to convince them to come back or will burst into tears.  </p>

<p>With the absence of their biological families, the boys had to make their own. </p>
<p>The boys look to Buster for advice on everything from “what should I say to this girl” to “which car should I buy?” </p>

<p>They help each other out in tough times. The loan money to each other if they need it and care for each other when they are hurt. </p>

<p>Almost all the boys who have left will help the kids who are still Amish. </p>

<p>They will take phones, cigarettes, radios, liquor and their cars out to the kids. They teach them how to use the phones and will collect money from them to pay their phone bill. They take their cars out to take kids on rides. Many of the boys will get calls to pick up a person from the Amish communities nearby. </p>

<p>The ones who are out will help new kids get on their feet in the English world. They help guide them in a way that they will be successful as an Ex-Amish person. </p>

<p>They bring them into their makeshift family and, together, they all raise a little hell. </p>
